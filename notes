•	By default the value of the object if printed is NULL 
•	This.name :Here the this is replaced with the name of the object which is calling
•	New keyword creates the object
•	Student kunal = new Student()
Here the Student() is the constructor which is being called or function you can say 
•	Instance Variables: Variables which are inside a class
•	Constructor overloading: having multiple constructors

•	Calling a constructor from another Constructor 

•	Student one= new Student()
Student two=one
If we make changes in one or two they will be reflected in both of them

•	Final is not modifyable but only for primitive data types
When  a non primitive is final, you cannot reassign it
	
•	Garbage collector using finalize 
We can only tell in finalize what to do when a file is being destroyed, when we create large number of object to it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	Packages are just folders
•	If the files are in same folder we don’t have to import 
•	A static variable is independent of the object created like population
Instead of using this.population, we will use human.population (human is class name) 
We can access the static variables using the name of the class itself 
As the class is created before the object is created, so we can access the object directly using class name 
The static method or variable belong to the class and do not belong to the object
We don’t need an object to run static stuff, they can be run with the help of a class 
IN SHORT STATIC IS NOT DEPENDENT ON OBJECT MAKING
•	Why is main as Public static void main 
It is static as if it was not static we would need an object to run the main, as it is inside the class. But how can we create an object of the main before running the program as main is the first thing which is run.
•	A static method can only access other static method
•	A static block is run only once when the first object is created
Static{
	B=A*5;
}
•	Singleton class only creates only 1 object

Inheritance: As properties of the parent class as well as their own characteristic( which is of child class ) 

If we want to initialise the values present in parent class JUST ABOVE the child class
we will use super keyword 
super(l,w,h)

agar private hai toh we can only use it inside a class ( agar parent mai private hai kuch toh child can't access it )  

If we write Box box = new BoxWeight() it is right
and we can use all the methods which are only inside the box not boxweight


BUT IF WE WRITE  BoxWeight box= new Box() THIS IS NOT RIGHT AS THE BOX() CANNOT MODIFY THE WEIGHT PROPERTY OF THE BOXWEIGHT AS ONLY THE CHILD ( BOXWEIGHT) HAS THE PROPERTY OF THE WEIGHT AND THE box IS REFERENCED TO BOX()

multiple inheritance is not allowed in java

heirarchiel inheritance 

POLYMORPHSIM: MANY + WAYS TO REPRESENT

TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM 
1) COMPILE TIME/ STATIC: ACHEIVED VIA METHOD OVERLOADING

SAME NAME OF METHODS BUT HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT LIKE DIFFERENT NUMBER OF PARAMETERS, DIFFERENT RETURN TYPES ETC

2) RUNTIME/ DYNAMIC: ACHEIVED VIA METHOD OVERRIDING

IF THE PARENT AND THE CHILD METHOD HAVE THE METHOD WITH SAME NAME THEN THE METHOD IN THE CHILD CLASS WILL BE CALLED AS IT IS OVERRIDDEN 

IF WE DO
shapes circle= new circle()
circle.area() 
this will also call the circle class ke andr wla area as it is overridden by the child class

IF WE USE THE FINAL KEYWORD IN THE PARENT CLASS METHOD THEN WE CANNOT OVERRIDE THAT METHOD IN THE CHILD CLASS

WE CAN ALSO PREVENT INHERITANCE USING FINAL CLASS 

WE ALSO CANNOT OVVERIDE STATIC METHODS, AS THE OVERRIDING DEPENEDS ON THE OBJECT ( circle() ) BUT AS WE KNOW STATIC METHODS DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE OBJECT, SO JO STATIC METHOD IS IN PARENT WILL ONLY GET PRINTED

encapsulation: one inside another 

abstraction: hiding the details and showing only valuable information
